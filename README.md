# Rectangles

Problem Description:

You are required to write code in the language of your choice implementing certain algorithms that analyze rectangles and features that exist among rectangles. Your implementation is required to cover the following:
1. Intersection:​ You must be able to determine whether two rectangles have one or more intersecting lines and produce a result identifying the points of intersection. 
2. Containment: ​You must​ ​be able to determine whether a rectangle is wholly contained within another rectangle.
3. Adjacency: ​Implement the ability to detect whether two rectangles are adjacent. Adjacency is defined as the sharing of at least one side. Side sharing may be proper, sub-line or partial. A sub-line share is a share where one side of rectangle A is a line that exists as a set of points wholly contained on some other side of rectangle B, where partial is one where some line segment on a side of rectangle A exists as a set of points on some side of Rectangle B.
